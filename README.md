# doctorOfficeDatabaseSQL

My sample database is for a small doctorâ€™s office and was made to complement my mock doctor's office website.  It can handle basic accounts payable and receivable and do all scheduling.  As with most small offices, sales reps come to meet with staff and bring sample medications, and often supply lunch or snacks, so they are welcome to come.  There are medStaff assigned to new patient evaluations and they also help with other appointments during the day as requested by physicians,
and are also assigned to meet with sales reps.  They will do lab work and take vital signs, etc.  My database could be improved upon by adding some additional columns such as city and state instead of just zip code to be able to do better queries.  As the office grows the database can be updated to make payment calculations automatic, and billing automatic.
